### Introduction

This project is a starting point for [Vue.js v3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) as the frontend UI library and [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) as headless CMS. The content is provided as JSON through Kirby and fetched by the frontend.

It's a simple, zero-setup, almost identical port of the [Kirby 3 starterkit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit) frontend (snippets, templates and their corresponding JS/CSS) to Vue.js single file components. By "almost" meaning that some features have been added like meta tags generation, environment variables support, accessible routing etc.

To compile the frontend sources, [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) comes to use. Vite is an opinionated web development build tool, created by Evan You. It serves code via native ES Module imports during development, allowing you to develop Vue.js single file components without a bundle step, and bundles it with Rollup for production. Features include:
- Lightning fast cold server start
- Instant hot module replacement (HMR)
- [Head over to the GitHub page](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for more details

## Caching & Offline Capability With Service Worker

Even without a service worker installed, the frontend will store pages between indiviual routes/views. When you reload the tab, the data for each page is freshly fetched from the API once again.

For offline capability of your Vue app, you can choose to activate the included [service worker](frontend/src/serviceWorker.js).

A visual explanation of both methods can be found in the following flow chart:

![Caching for Kirby and Vue 3 starterkit](./.github/kirby-vue-3-cache-and-store.png)

The service worker precaches all CSS & JS assets required by the Vue app and caches the data of every requested page. All assets are versioned and served from the service worker cache directly.

Each JSON request will be freshly fetched from the network and saved to the cache. If the user's navigator turns out to be offline, the cached page request will be returned.

## Stale-While-Revalidate

The stale-while-revalidate mechanism for the [`usePage`](frontend/src/hooks/usePage.js) hook allows you to respond as quickly as possible with cached page data if available, falling back to the network request if it's not cached. The network request is then used to update the cached page data – which directly affects the view after lazily assigning changes (if any), thanks to Vue's reactivity.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js with npm (only required to build the frontend)
- PHP 7.4+

> Kirby is not a free software. You can try it for free on your local machine but in order to run Kirby on a public server you must purchase a [valid license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

## Setup

1. Duplicate the [`.env.example`](.env.example) as `.env` and optionally adapt its values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**Note**: Composer dependencies are tracked in this repository by default. Running `composer install` isn't necessary.

## Usage

### Serve Backend & Frontend for Development

```bash
# Runs `npm run kirby:serve` and `vite` in parallel
npm run dev
```

Out of the box the backend is automatically served while developing. `npm run kirby:serve` spawns the PHP built-in web server by Node. You can also serve the backend by a web server of your choice. If done so, please specify hostname and port in your `.env` if they differ from `localhost`and `8080` respectively so that the decoupled frontend can call the Kirby API for JSON content in development.

### Compile for Production

Build the frontend assets (CSS & JS files) to `public/assets`:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment

1. Deploy the repository on your server.
2. Duplicate [`.env.example`](.env.example) as `.env`.
3. Install npm dependencies and build frontend assets: `npm i && npm run build`.
4. Change variables in your `.env`:
   - `KIRBY_CACHE` to `true` (recommended)
5. Point your web server to the `public` folder.
6. Some hosting environments require to uncomment `RewriteBase /` in [`.htaccess`](public/.htaccess) to make site links work.

Now your project is hopefully up 'n' running!

## Configuration

All development and production related configurations for both backend and frontend code are located in your `.env` file:
- `KIRBY_SERVER_HOSTNAME` and `KIRBY_SERVER_PORT` specify the address where you wish the Kirby backend to be served from. It is used by the frontend to fetch content data as JSON.
- Keys starting with `VITE_` are available in your code following the `import.meta.env.VITE_CUSTOM_VARIABLE` syntax.

For example setting `KIRBY_CACHE` to `true` is useful in development environment.

### Content API Slug

To change the API slug to fetch JSON-encoded page data from, set
- `CONTENT_API_SLUG` to a value of your liking (defaults to `spa`). It can even be left empty to omit a slug altogether!

> You can't use Kirby's internal API slug (defaults to `api`). If you insist on using `api` for *your* content endpoint, you can rename Kirby's by adding a `KIRBY_API_SLUG` key and set it to something other than `api`.

### Multi-Language

Multiple languages are supported. A comprehensive introduction about [multi-language setups](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/languages/introduction) may be found on the Kirby website.

To enable language handling, you don't have to edit the [`config.php`](site/config/config.php) manually. Just set
- `KIRBY_MULTILANG` to `true`.
- `KIRBY_MULTILANG_DETECT` to `true` (optional but recommended).

Then, visit the panel and add new languages by your liking. The Panel **automatically renames all existing content** and file meta data files and includes the language extension.

Language data is provided by the global `site` object, which can be accessed via the `useSite()` hook.

ℹ️ **Current limitations**:
- Custom language paths aren't supported as of right now, the language code defined will be used as a base in the frontend.
- Automatic language detection only works in production environment. In development the fallback language is always the default language.

### Service Worker

To enable the **service worker** which precaches essential assets and page API calls for offline capability, set:
- `VITE_ENABLE_SW` to `true`

> ⚠️ Don't change the `CONTENT_API_SLUG` once you deployed your app publicly and thus a service worker is installed on clients. Otherwise fetch requests will fail and a blank page will show until the new service worker is activated, which then is only possible by closing the tab/PWA.

### Stale-While-Revalidate

To keep page data fresh with **stale-while-revalidate**, set:
- `VITE_ENABLE_SWR` to `true`
